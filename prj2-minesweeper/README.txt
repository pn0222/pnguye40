This program compiles properly under eclipse, but since Dr. Java is an older compiler there might be some issue.
Requires java compilation of 1.7 +
If run in Dr Java, there might be an issue of 858 - 867, if so just comment it out to operate the program.
This portion of the code basically takes the new user score and writes it to "topten.txt."
